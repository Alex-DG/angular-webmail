## API

### copy( target:Object, source:Object[, no_overwrite:Boolean] ):Object
Copies the properties – accessible via `Object.keys` – from the `source` Object to the `target` Object and returns the `target` Object.

#### Example:

```javascript

	var copy = require( 'useful-copy' );

    var foo = { one : 1, two : 2, three : 3 },
        bar = copy( {}, foo );

    bar          // returns => { "one" : 1, "two" : 2, "three" : 3 }

    foo === bar  // returns => false

    copy( foo, { three : 3.3, four : 4 }, true ); // returns => { "one" : 1, "two" : 2, "three" : 3, "four" : 4 }

```

### copy.merge( target:Array|Object, source:Array|Object ):Boolean
Performs a "deep copy" of all the properties in `source` to `target`, so that `target` does not reference any child Arrays and/ or Objects that belong to `source`.

### copy.update( target:Array|Object, source:Array|Object ):Boolean
Performs a "deep copy" of all the properties in `source` **that are not already contained in** `target`, so that `target` does not reference any child Arrays and/ or Objects that belong to `source`.

This works similarly to `copy.merge` except that existing properties are not overwritten.
